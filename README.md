About the effect of normalization on outliers and evaluation of outlier detection methods via instance space techniques

Folder structure

  (1) Data
  
      Contains the following folders
      
      (1.1) Datasets - The files were too big to host on github even after being zipped. The datasets will be available on MATILDA (http://matilda.unimelb.edu.au) soon. 
      
      (1.2) Features_and_performance - Contains 3 files
      
            (1.2.1) Features.zip
            
            This zip file contains the file Features.csv, which has all features used in the instance space analysis. 
            
            (1.2.2) Performance_values.csv
            
            This file contains the performance values used in instance space analysis. That is, for each dataset and 
            each outlier detection method, we choose the maximum performance value from the 4 normalization schemes Min-Max, Mean-SD, 
            Median-IQR and Median-MAD. 
            
            (1.2.3) Performance_values_4_Norm_Methods.csv
            
            This file contains the performance values for all 4 normalization schemes and outlier methods.
