About the effect of normalization on outliers and evaluation of outlier detection methods via instance space techniques

There are many normalization/standardization methods. Some of them are min-max, mean-std, median-iqr and median-mad. Does the normalization method have any effect on outlier detection? Are some normalization methods better than others? Or does it depend on the dataset? Or does it depend on the outlier detection method? We investigate these questions.
