Does normalizing your data affect outlier detection?

It is common practice to normalize data before using an outlier detection method. But which method should we use to normalize the data? Does it matter? The short answer is yes, it does. The choice of normalization method may increase or decrease the effectiveness of an outlier detection method on a given dataset. In this talk we investigate this triangular relationship between datasets, normalization methods and outlier detection methods.
